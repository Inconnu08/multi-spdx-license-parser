# Multi SPDX License Parser
A tool for detecting the SPDX license identifier from a LICENSE file following the SPDX License List Matching Guidelines.
The SPDX License List is a list of well-known, commonly-used, and Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved open-source software
licenses. 
The primary goal would be to properly represent the licenses of a code repository with an SPDX identifier or 
display a license expression if a package contains more than one license.
